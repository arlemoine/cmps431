## Assignment 2

The purpose of this assignment is to simulate a CPU scheduler, scheduling processes on two processing cores. The scheduler is designed to be operating with the First-Come-First-Serve algorithm. This implementation is performed by the use of a global core variable which houses the status of two cores. It also consists of the use of threads to simulate processes running on the two cores. When each process finishes running, its stats are printed at standard output.
