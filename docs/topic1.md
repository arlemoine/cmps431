## My Introduction

Hello, my name is Adriean Lemoine. I'm 29 years old and a third year Computer Science student. 
In 5 years, I see myself working in the DevOps division of a medium sized company (where I currently am). This is because I find joy in the process of coordinating work between groups, automating work with scripts, and managing workflows. In 5 years, I also see myself at a lot of sports events for my two children who will be in middle school and high school. 
In 20 years, I see myself working as the CIO of a medium sized company, managing the overall technology strategy and operations of the company. 
My hope for this class is to learn a lot about process optimization because of the fact that computational efficiency is increasingly important in our highly technological society. 
In my spare time, my favorite thing to do is tinker with and update services on my homelab to provide fun and useful services to my family and friends.
